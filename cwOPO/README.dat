This code is useful for simulations on Optical Parametric Oscillators.
It solves the coupled-wave equations for signal and pump using a parallel computing scheme that uses the library THRUST.
This makes this code easely scalable as well as readable.

For running this code is necessary to have a GPU in your computer and installed the CUDA drivers and the CUDA-TOOLKIT as well.

If you use Linux as an operative system, this project shuold be work well, but take care on the flag sm_75 defined here. 
This flag accounts for the GPU architecture and may be different in another GPU. 
If you do not know which is the suitable flag to compile you need, please visit or google the something like
"NVIDIA + My GPU Model + architecture". For instance, "Nvidia Geforce MX250 architecture" returns something like
GeForce MX200 Series	 GeForce MX250 384 @ 1.52 - 1.58 GHz 64 Bit @ 7000 MHz GeForce MX230 256 @ 1.52 - 1.53 GHz 64 Bit @ 7000 MHz
Codename	             N17S-G2
Architecture	         Pascal
Pipelines	             384 - unified
TMUs	                 32

Then, knowing my architecture is Pascal, go to the NVIDIA documentation in https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/pascal-compatibility-guide/index.html
You will find that for this specific model the proper flag is sm_30 among others, but not sm_75. This is because this code was tested in a
Turing GPU and sm_75 is the proper flag for that architecture.

There also is a shell file (cwOPO.sh) where you can define all the parameters that you can pass the main file. In my case, I needed to modify
parameters such as number of round trips, grid size, among other relevant parameters.
