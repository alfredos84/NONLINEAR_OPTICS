cuOPO is a C/CUDA toolkit for simulating optical parametric oscillators using the coupled-wave equations (CWEs) that well-describe the three wave mixing (TWM) processes in a second-order nonlinear media.

The provided software implements a solver for the CWEs including dispersion terms, linear absorption and intracavity element if they are required. It also includes flags to solve nanosecond or continuous wave time regimes.
