# NONLINEAR_OPTICS
I performed a code to solve the Generalized Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (GNLSE). This equations describes well the light propagations in waveguides. In particular, this code applies for pulses and continuous wave propagating in sigle-mode fiber optics. 
My code are based on a hybrid-computing, i.e., parallel and sequential computations. You should have a GPU card on your PC.

What do I need to run the code?

You need a GPU card because my code is written in C-CUDA. Launching kernels is needed before simulating anything to test the correct working of your GPU drivers.
All libraries are included in the package or in the CUDA DRIVER.
