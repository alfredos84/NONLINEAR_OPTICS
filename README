This code simulates the generalized Sch√∂dinger non-linear equation (GNLSE) using the Split-Step Method with Runge-Kutta 4 interaction picture embedded (RK4-IP).
It is programmed in C / CUDA since it uses hybrid computation between CPU and GPU. To execute it type in a terminal

$ nvcc SSFM.cu functions.cu -lcufftw -lcufft -lcurand -o SSFMcu

and execute it as

$ ./SSFMcu

Note that you must have some CUDA libraries installed. For this you can download the NVIDIA / CUDA drivers from the page
